# Okane
Version 1.0 of my personal trading bot. Determines good entry points into the stock market by evaluating several technical indicators.

### Motivation
I started this project after participating in the 6th Hack Cambridge Hackathon, where my team created an algorithmic arbitrage trading bot that ran in a simulated environment. I really liked the idea of getting passive income (or potentially passive loss) while I work on other things. I was also interested in the stock market, so I decided to give it a try.

### What it does
This version of Okane gets live quotes on a target symbol (or list of symbols), calculates its performance using my own strategy.

### Technologies Used
  - Programming Languages: Python
  - Packages/API: [Alpaca Market API v2.0](https://alpaca.markets), [bta-lib](https://github.com/mementum/bta-lib)

### What I learnt
  - Trading basics.
  - Using websockets (to retrieve live quotes).
  - Using pandas dataframes (for storing market data).
